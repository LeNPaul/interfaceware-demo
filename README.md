# iNTERFACEARE Demo

This was my demo that I created for my interview with [iNTERFACEWARE](https://www.interfaceware.com/), a healthcare software company that builds [Iguana](https://www.interfaceware.com/iguana.html), a healthcare integration engine. It uses Iguana to power a full-stack web application. The back-end is handled by Lua, which serves the web pages and searches a SQL database for patient information, returning the information in JSON format. The front-end is done using typical web languages and libraries, including AngularJS and jQuery.
